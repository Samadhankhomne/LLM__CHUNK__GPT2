# LLM__CHUNK__GPT2
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- Explanation of the Code

- Loading the Model and Tokenizer:

- The code loads a pre-trained GPT-2 model and its corresponding tokenizer. You can replace "gpt2" with any other compatible model.

- Chunking Function:
The chunk_text function takes a string of text and splits it into chunks of a specified maximum length (in tokens). It encodes the text into tokens and then slices it into manageable pieces.

- Generating Responses:
The generate_responses function iterates through each chunk, generates a response using the model, and decodes the output back into text.

- Putting It All Together:
A long text is created (you can replace this with your actual text).
The text is chunked, and responses are generated for each chunk.

- Output
The output will show responses generated for each chunk of the input text, allowing you to process longer texts effectively without exceeding the token limit of the model.

- Note
When processing multiple chunks, consider how to handle overlapping content, especially if the chunks are related, to maintain context. You might want to implement strategies like including the last few tokens of the previous chunk in the next one.
